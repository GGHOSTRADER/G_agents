----- AGENTIC WORK OPTIMIZATION -----

Software developing
--------------------
Goal: Balance between Autonomy while keeping clarity and maintainability.

-Prompting
As a efficient python developer and clean architecture software engineer

-Code Generating for reability and maintainability: 
1) Ask for heavy documentation inside file on each function and doc string summary
2) PURE FUNCTIONS: Ask agent to create pure functions, one function per action, so avoid nested functions, always have doc string describing the function in 8 words and telling what is the input and output. Use variables linting (check proper name). Also ask to avoi calling functions inside functions.
3) Generate "dry" summary, Functions names, description of function in 1 sentence, necessary inputs with data type and what output with what datatype, state if it has side effects.
4) High level summary and goal of the whole script
5) Runtime Chain ( To see the actual flow of the application)
6) Function Dependency Graph ( To understand what depends on what but if pure functions this should be limited)
7) Use of type hints for functions


-Contex for LLM
1) Give Tree structure to LLM, use Tree in Linux
2) Give imports with clear relative paths, be expecific that they are already made
3) Give breef summary of imported functions, with input and output data types and what they do in 1 sentence, so LLM wont put extra arguments



-Bug Handling
1) Ask: give solution to this problem, with why you choose this way, what did you change
2) Be expecific about what lines it can change and what it CANNOT change or touch
3) Color/Label code changes on code and on 5 words why it was done + Date (line number of changes)

-Testing and Architectural design
5) TDD Implementation, Human user gives tests to pass and let agent develop the solution to pass the test.

-Offline solutions
7) LOCAL LLM for coding offline, probably no solution generating.
	Provide clear relative path in instructions with
